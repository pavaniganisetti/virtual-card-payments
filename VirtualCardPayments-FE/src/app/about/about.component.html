               A <strong>Virtual Card</strong> is a unique 16-digit random number that solely
                created for one-time-use between payer and payee.

                <strong>Security:</strong> Virtual Card numbers are generated randomly with specific amount limit 
                and expiry time after which the card expires. So, No one can use it  without the exact payment amount and/or
                itâ€™s outside the time window.
